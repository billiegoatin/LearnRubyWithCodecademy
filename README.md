Learning Ruby with Codecademy

So this repository is mainly for me to upload my junk ruby scripts. Right now they are junk, but I am hoping that with more and more practice they become better and better. For now they are just simple little programs/scripts that curse at you. I hope they internet can handle the amount of "fucks" and "assholes" I put into these tiny scripts.
